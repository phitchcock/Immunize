## Project Information

### Project Name
Immunize

### Project Description
Immunize is based on the pitch given by Laura McCasland from the Department of Health and Human Services.

The project consists of a Rails backend that the department can input all locations for free flu immunization shots.
The Rails application has a built in push notification service.  This gives the department the ability
to connect with anyone that has downloaded the app. Sending notifications on updated locations, times or
additional locations.

The second application in this project is the iOS application.  The app shows the locations of the mobile clinics
including date, time and a map of the location.  The app accepts the push notifications from the Rails server.
